# BASIC FUNCTIONALITY 

### Implement a simple web-page which allows a user to register & login, the user should have (at a minimum), username, forename, surname and email as well as any attributes necessary for authentication.

### The user should have a profile_image attribute.
- This should not be set at registration, but set once the user has signed in.

### User further migration(s) to add extra attributes to the user: 
- Date of Birth
- Gender
- Phone Number
- Any other attributes you feel necessary

### On signing in, the user should be allowed to update their profile information.
- If the user doesn't have a profile_image, they must set it at this point.

### In addition to this, implement a simple API endpoint, which given a user_id will return information about the appropriate user.
- The information to be returned is: forename, surname, gender as well as the time that that user was created at.
- It would be nice if the API required a user to be authenticated, but this is not mandatory.
- This endpoint should return the user information in JSON.
